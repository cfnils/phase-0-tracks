###What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

* open source
* many different versions and distributions
*  very powerful, assumes you know what you're doing (and if you don't you could get into some trouble)


###In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

* its a virtual computer that exists in the cloud. it runs its own operating system. it exists in the cloud as a piece of disk space. although it behaves like a distinct computer, its not an actual seperate computer.


###Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

* if you don't know what you're doing you can do more damage in the root
* if you're running as root if there are any security vulnerabilities that are exploited they will be able to do a lot more damage with root access
