###What are some common HTTP status codes?

* 200 OK
* 400 Bad request (syntax error in the request)
* 404 Not Found
* 503 Service unavailable (something wrong with server)

###What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

* Get just gets data from the server and post sends data to the server before getting something back
* post will be used when the request will change something 

###What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

* My sense is that a cookie is a text file held on the client side and used by the server to identify users. It is stored by the browser and part of it (the "value") is submitted to the server when it makes HTTP requests. Hope that was reasonably accurate.
