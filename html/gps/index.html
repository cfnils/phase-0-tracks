<!-- Reflection
1. The purpose of the semantic tags is to make it easier to understand your code. As John showed us, when its all <div>'s it can be hard to quickly see what is going into a given section. I think header and footer are probably the most useful
2. Not Sure about the browser display order, i googled it and found tali garsiel's site which was a little over my head.
3. I learned more about snippets. If I need to create my own snippets I now know enough about them that I should be able to figure it out, but I don't know whether I will use them or not. 
4. The challenge was not too challenging overall.
