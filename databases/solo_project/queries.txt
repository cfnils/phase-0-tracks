Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

sqlite> SELECT * from books;
1|Mastery|1|2012|true
2|The 48 Laws of Power|1|1998|true
3|The 50th Law|1|2009|false
4|Trust me, I'm Lying|2|2012|true
5|The Obstacle is the Way|2|2014|false
6|Zero to One|3|2014|true
7|Mindset|4|2007|false


Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

2|The 48 Laws of Power|1|1998|true
3|The 50th Law|1|2009|false
4|Trust me, I'm Lying|2|2012|true
5|The Obstacle is the Way|2|2014|true
6|Zero to One|3|2014|true
7|Mindset|4|2007|false

The 50th Law|Robert Greene
Trust me, I'm Lying|Ryan Holiday
The Obstacle is the Way|Ryan Holiday
Zero to One|Peter Thiel

Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> DELETE FROM books WHERE author_id=3;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM books JOIN authors ON books.author_id=authors.id;         1|Mastery|1|2012|true|1|Robert Greene
2|The 48 Laws of Power|1|1998|true|1|Robert Greene
3|The 50th Law|1|2009|false|1|Robert Greene
4|Trust me, I'm Lying|2|2012|true|2|Ryan Holiday

Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt.

sqlite> SELECT books.title, authors.name FROM books FULL OUTER JOIN authors ON books.author_id=authors.id;
Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported
sqlite> SELECT books.title, authors.name FROM books JOIN authors ON books.author_id=authors.id WHERE year_published > 2012;
